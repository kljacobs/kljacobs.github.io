I am an assistant professor and extension economist in the Department of Economics at Iowa State University, and I currently hold the Iowa Institute for Cooperatives Economics Professorship.  My appointment began in late 2012 and is a 50% extension, 35% research, and 15% teaching appointment with a focus on cooperatives.  To fulfill this appointment, I teach an undergraduate course on cooperatives (Econ 332 Cooperatives), conduct research on cooperative businesses with a focus on ownership and capital structure, and work with industry stakeholders and partners to developed extension programming to address the needs of cooperatives in our state.  

The three roles – extension, research, and teaching – are intended to be synergistic: what I learn from my research supplements the cooperative course content and is shared via extension programming with cooperative leaders from industry and academia.  Likewise, interaction with cooperative board members and managers provides direction for my extension programming, informs my research agenda, and provides richness to the undergraduate course.
