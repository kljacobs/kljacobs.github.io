As a graduate student and early-career faculty, my research program developed at the intersection of conservation policy, agricultural production and land use decisions. My dissertation work, which considered outcomes of the Conservation Reserve Program in terms of the political economy and also a farmer’s land-use decisions, was motivated by my familiarity with agriculture and also curiosity over the purported “inefficient” outcomes of conservation programs targeted at agricultural production. That focus led to grants and collaborative opportunities with scientists in other disciplines such as agronomy, agricultural and biosystems engineering, and animal science.

While I remain involved and interested in research that dovetails with agricultural production and producers’ land-use decisions, my research efforts have shifted to focus on cooperatives. I analyze trends in financial performance of cooperatives and explore the structural changes, prices, and market share in the markets where agricultural cooperatives compete.  Exteral funding through grants, contracts, and financial gifts provide ongoing support to undergraduate and graduate students interested in investigating cooperatives.
