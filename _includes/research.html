                <p>As a graduate student and early-career faculty, my research program was at the intersection of
conservation policy and agricultural production and land use decisions.  My dissertation work, which sought to understand outcomes of the Conservation Reserve Program in terms of the political economy and also a farmer’s land-use decisions, was motivated by my familiarity with agriculture and also curiosity over the seeming “inefficient” outcomes of conservation programs targeted at agricultural production. That focus led to grants and collaborative opportunities with scientists in other disciplines such as agronomy, agricultural and biosystems engineering, and animal science.</p>
                <p>
Today, while I remain involved and interested in research opportunities that dovetail with agricultural production and producers’ land-use decisions, my research efforts have shifted to include the economics of cooperatives.  The cooperative business model is a unique one with interesting implications for firms’ capital structure, ownership, and financing.  These comprise the majority of my current and expected projects in the area of cooperatives.  I am grateful and fortunate to have direct financial support for these from the Iowa Institute for Cooperatives Economics Professorship endowment and also CoBank.  Their giving provides ongoing support to undergraduate and graduate students interested in understanding and investigating cooperatives.
